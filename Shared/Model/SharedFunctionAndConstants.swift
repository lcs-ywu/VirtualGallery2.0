Jackson Pollock was widely noticed for his technique of pouring or splashing liquid household paint onto a horizontal surface ("drip technique"), enabling him to view and paint his canvases from all angles. It was also called all-over painting and "action painting", since he covered the entire canvas and used the force of his whole body to paint, often in a frenetic dancing style. This extreme form of abstraction divided the critics: some praised the immediacy of the creation, while others derided the random effects. In 2016, Pollock's painting titled Number 17A was reported to have fetched US$200 million in a private purchase.

A reclusive and volatile personality, Pollock struggled with alcoholism for most of his life. In 1945, he married the artist Lee Krasner, who became an important influence on his career and on his legacy. Pollock died at the age of 44 in an alcohol-related single-car accident when he was driving. In December 1956, four months after his death, Pollock was given a memorial retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. A larger, more comprehensive exhibition of his work was held there in 1967. In 1998 and 1999, his work was honored with large-scale retrospective exhibitions at MoMA and at The Tate in London.

Andy Warhol born Andrew Warhola; was an American artist, film director, and producer who was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, advertising, and celebrity culture that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, silkscreening, photography, film, and sculpture. Some of his best known works include the silkscreen paintings Campbell's Soup Cans (1962) and Marilyn Diptych (1962), the experimental films Empire (1964) and Chelsea Girls (1966), and the multimedia events known as the Exploding Plastic Inevitable (1966–67).

Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Warhol initially pursued a successful career as a commercial illustrator. After exhibiting his work in several galleries in the late 1950s, he began to receive recognition as an influential and controversial artist. His New York studio, The Factory, became a well-known gathering place that brought together distinguished intellectuals, drag queens, playwrights, Bohemian street people, Hollywood celebrities, and wealthy patrons. He promoted a collection of personalities known as Warhol superstars, and is credited with inspiring the widely used expression "15 minutes of fame". In the late 1960s he managed and produced the experimental rock band The Velvet Underground and founded Interview magazine. He authored numerous books, including The Philosophy of Andy Warhol and Popism: The Warhol Sixties. He lived openly as a gay man before the gay liberation movement. In June 1968, he was almost killed by radical feminist Valerie Solanas who shot him inside his studio.

After gallbladder surgery, Warhol died of cardiac arrhythmia in February 1987 at the age of 58.

Warhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective exhibitions, books, and feature and documentary films. The Andy Warhol Museum in his native city of Pittsburgh, which holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives, is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist. Many of his creations are very collectible and highly valuable. The highest price ever paid for a Warhol painting is US$105 million for a 1963 canvas titled Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster); his works include some of the most expensive paintings ever sold. A 2009 article in The Economist described Warhol as the "bellwether of the art market".

    Artist(name: "Michelangelo Pistoletto", age: "23 June 1933 (age 88)", identity: "Italian Painting", infor: """
Michelangelo Pistoletto (born 23 June 1933 in Biella) is an Italian painter, action and object artist, and art theorist. Pistoletto is acknowledged as one of the main representatives of the Italian Arte Povera. His work mainly deals with the subject matter of reflection and the unification of art and everyday life in terms of a Gesamtkunstwerk.

From 1947 until 1958, Pistoletto worked in his father's restoration workshop in Turin. In the 1950s, he started painting figurative works and self-portraits. In 1959, he participated in the Biennale di San Marino. In the following year, he had his first solo exhibition in the Galleria Galatea in Turin. In the beginning of the 1960s, Pistoletto started painting figurative works and self-portraits which he painted on a monochrome, metallic background. Later on, he combined painting with photography using collage techniques on reflective backgrounds. Eventually, he switched over to printing photorealistic scenes on steel plates polished to a high finish. He did that using the screen-printing method which made the observer almost completely melt in with what was depicted. In the mid-1960s, gallery owner Ileana Sonnabend brought him into contact with an international audience.

In 1965/1966, he produced the series of works Oggetti in meno (Minus Objects), which belongs to Pistoletto's early sculptural works. In 1966, Pistoletto had his first solo exhibition in the US, at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. In 1967, his work was awarded first prize in the Biennale de São Paulo. In the same year, Pistoletto started focusing on performance, video art and theatre. He founded an action art group, called "Zoo Group", which gave several performances between 1968 and 1970. These took place in the studio, public buildings or on the streets of Turin or other large cities. As was already the case with Pistoletto's 2-dimensional and sculptural works, the aim was to display the unity of art and everyday life.

Donald Clarence Judd was an American artist associated with minimalism (a term he nonetheless stridently disavowed). In his work, Judd sought autonomy and clarity for the constructed object and the space created by it, ultimately achieving a rigorously democratic presentation without compositional hierarchy. He is generally considered the leading international exponent of "minimalism," and its most important theoretician through such writings as "Specific Objects" (1964). Judd voiced his unorthodox perception of minimalism in Arts Yearbook 8, where he asserts; "The new three dimensional work doesn't constitute a movement, school, or style. The common aspects are too general and too little common to define a movement. The differences are greater than the similarities."

Since then, I'm looking for something attractive and challenging myself to do new things, such as trying sports I've never done, switching school, and finding my next dream.

    But there is one thing that I keep continuing since I was little. It is creating art. When I was little, there were always colourful crayons and a few sketchbooks in my house and I could draw anything whenever I wanted to. My mother drew and painted a lot of things with me and my father thought me how to use other tools such as cutters and crafted together on weekends. When I was alone having some time, I created toys with empty boxes and coloured paper. When it was one of my family members' birthday, I painted flowers. When I traveled, I sketched the views and food. And one of my favourite works was a house made with cardboard. Because of this environment for being creative, I naturally started to love art and it became a part of my life even though the style of art that I create had changed as I grew up.

    When I look back my life, art is always with me and it allows me to be creative, express myself, and be free.

    Art makes my life colourful!

    Art has always been a huge part of my life and it is one of the first things I remember doing aside from walking or talking, of course. For this reason, I don't think I could pinpoint at which point in my life my interest for it sparked. However, since the age of around 5, I vividly remember using art as a source of expression but also something I solely did for fun. At school, art has always been one of my favourite subjects, and has been a lifelong hobby of mine. Last year, I took grade 11 art, which I personally think pushed my limits and allowed me to try many new things in the realm of art.

    I would consider myself a self taught artist as art has been something I have never taken an official class for (outside fo school), but learned through trial and error, and years of practice. Like many artists, my art skills and techniques have undoubtedly progressed a great deal since I started drawing when I was only four years old. I've learned a tremendous amount through practice like new and effective techniques, and played around with materials to see which ones I do and do not like.

    My source of inspiration is admiring other artist's work and finding new things to draw through social media. For me, following artists on instagram and seeing their work motivates me to create something just as creative, myself. When I see other people make amazing and original things, I find myself wanting to draw something just as good and it, in a way, stimulates my creative thinking. Something else I love doing is going on Pinterest in search of reference photos. Pinterest has come to be one of my favourite platforms in order to find photos to draw because it is extremely easy to find unique and mesmerizing photos that fit your aesthetic. When I find a photo on Pinterest or Instagram that I have a strong urge to draw, I can normally visualize what materials I want to use to recreate it, which is essentially all I need to get started on my creative process. Lastly, making art for people always gives me a sense of joy because it is always something personal. Even as a child, I specifically remember drawing my aunt's dog and my grandparents, and whenever I visit, I see those drawings still hung up in their living room. Although I cringe at my technique from when I was younger, I know it gives them a lot of joy when I draw things for them and why they kept those drawings after all these years. Thus, I would consider the people around me to act as an influence as well.

    Materials that I love using are graphite and coloured pencils. Graphite is what I am most comfortable using because I have been using it the longest and have learned a lot on how to use it and the different techniques that are useful when using it. Although I still have a lot to learn when it comes to coloured pencils, they are something I have always strived to master because I have always admired how coloured pencil drawings look in their final form. Materials that I am currently experimenting with and would love to get better at using is paint, specifically acrylic and watercolour. Styles that I would like to try or try perfecting are surrealism, realism, and utilizing more colour in my artwork.

    My name is Bossongbra Aka Marc-Aurèle. Originally from West Africa, Côte D'Ivoire. I originally grew up there until the age of five where I moved to Tanzania. I then got the opportunity to travel around both Africa and Europe mainly exposing me to all sorts of cultures and perspectives. I've only just recently over the past four years been exposed to western culture. This allowed me to gain a love for traveling, architecture, arts, and even psychology. I currently go to school in Lakefield college school as a boarder and return to either the Ivory Coast or Tanzania

    My other interests mainly involve sports and learning. I adore snow sports such as snowboarding and nordic skiing. Water sports such as sailing and windsurfing greatly amuse me, and things like rock climbing and cross country running keep me active. Team sports such as football, basketball, and rugby are great to practice during spring. Other hobbies include studying astronomy, Architecture, and Psychology. Researching history and random knowledge have recently become something of interest due to my newfound realization of the knowledge I lack. Design and crochet are points of interest occasionally though it is something that could be afforded more time.

    Regarding art styles, I don't have any specific preferences. I am aware that I require a higher skill level for painting for which I intend to attain. My goal is to become proficient in most if not all art styles to some degree and apply that to graphic design and animation.

    Since as far as I can remember, art has been a fascinating hobby of mine. Originally something is done to past time and creat for fun later became a source of comfort. upon looking at other artists I grew a desire to test out new art styles and techniques.  I had originally been enticed due to the Japanese animated shows known as anime. My cousins and I would watch show after show and the act of bringing a fictional character to life with a pen fascinated and drove me to learn a lot more about it.

    As I grew older it changed into a skill I wanted to perfect. I desired to create my own style while learning about others. I used art to express feelings and emotions that could not be shown through words.

    The work I have produced over the years aren't always very consistent as I like to work with many types of media so every piece unique. When planning out a projects, ideas don't come easy so I always have a pencil in hand and some scrap paper to scribble down my plans. My art is typically very basic but with a well thought out back story and a tactile component.

    My love of art started at a young age and has grown so much over time. As a child I would go out into the woods and use nature as my canvas and make 3D sculptures of whatever I found. Although I did enjoy drawing, it was never really a strong suit of mine so I stuck to tactile work instead.

    I was born in the small down of east city surrounded by family and many friends. At the age of seven, my family and I moved to New Zealand for a year and got to learn and grow so much. Even at this age I was often told I was a wise child and I can thank my parents for this. As each day passed I would listen and look around at the beauty and sadness the people and the world had to offer. The following Christmas we got a phone call from my grandparents saying if we moved home now we could buy the farm from them. To this day I live in the township of Selwyn just outside Peterborough city.

    The types of work I do as mentioned early are very hands on. I took many pottery classes growing up and choose painting over drawing any day. I hope in the future I reach out and try new medias but so far this is me.

                This section of my project shows butterflies, clouds, and book paper The purple butterflies are handmade. Around the world, people view the butterfly as representing endurance, change, hope, and life. Butterflies are very symbolic to me as I have been through a lot of changes in my life that make me who I am. Through the lowest points in my life, I have endured change and learned hope. A simple object reminds me to keep pushing and that change is okay. This aspect of myself has been represented by an acrylic painting of a butterfly that drew with art pencils. I laid the butterflies on a collage of book scraps that were brushed with coffee so that the paper would appear old. This represents me being an Old-soul. Also, my love of literature.
                
                I have made this aspect of the piece very intricate and whimsical. I took a creative risk and used real flowers and dirt in which I pressed into a glued bristol board. The flowers took the longest time as it was quite trial and error, Ironing and using the printing press was a setback until a very lovely peer inspired me with a suggestion to microwave the flowers. Into the dirt, I have made root-like figures using paper maché - which will now lead to what this means to me. I am a very spiritual person and I stay true to my values. In a way, I stay true to my roots and my family. My family has been the most important thing to me for as long as I have remembered.

                This piece is called In My Mind because, in a literal sense, it is revealing the inside of my mind. The portrait is drawn with coloured pencils while the shirt is comprised of magazine cutouts of a variety of flowers. The solid background is painted with watercolour and decorated with gold leaf. This was another one of my pieces that I wanted to be in colour because it pulls the drawing together. For instance, the use of blue for the face in the middle was essential in what message I wanted to set forth with this drawing. My intention for this artwork was to take a look into my mind and who I think I am on the inside, because there is so much more to someone than what is shown on the outside. I illustrated my head splitting in half down the middle to exhibit a 'second head' that represents my mind. I chose blue to represent my mind because if I were a colour, I think I would be blue. When you think of blue, you think of the sky or the sea; commonly calm things. Blue is also not a harsh colour; it's soft and, in a way, 'trustworthy' or 'approachable.'
                
                For this reason, I chose blue to symbolize the calm and collected way in which I carry myself and how others see me. The flowers covering my shirt are not only to add an interesting aspect to the drawing , but display my top VIA character strength: love. Flowers can symbolize a lot of things, but in this case, I used them to show my greatest strength of love, as flowers are often used as a token of appreciation. The specks of gold leaf in he background were just to add something that felt missing in the drawing, and I think were the perfect finalizing detail in this piece. This is one of my favourite artworks in the entire series because it is one of the coolest. My attempts to recreate what I had in my head for this were very successful in my opinion, and may have even exceeded my expectations for it. Specifically, I am very happy with how the colouring turned out and I feel as though the other media that was used worked well with each other.

    Artwork(name: "Serenity", artist: "Alana Kim", yearCreated: 2020, description: """
                This piece is called Serenity. It is an oil painting on a 3ft by 2ft canvas. I decided to do an oil painting because it was a medium that I did not have much experience with, but wanted to try. The only time I had used oil paint in the past was in a previous assignment where we painted facial expressions on wooden panels. After that, I wanted to continue practicing with with it because of how much I loved the consistency and how easily they blended with each other. However, before starting the painting process, I made sure to watch videos about painting with oil paint in order to pick up some valuable tips before getting started so that I could get a deeper understanding of how to successfully work with the medium. I mainly focused on how to mix skin tones as well as how to accurately paint water. Painting water was something that I had never done before therefore, for me, it was crucial that I had at least some knowledge on how to do it beforehand. Ultimately, this preparation helped me become more confident in what I was doing and I managed to apply a lot of what I learned into my work. During the painting process, I learned a lot along the way about oil paint and what techniques work the best for certain things. Overall, I treated this process as a learning experience that took trial and error and a lot of patience. The biggest advice I would give for using oil paints is to blend, but also take the time to analyze your reference photo to know what colours to use and know how to mix them. The face was the most stressful part because I wanted it to look as realistic as possible. I rarely ever used the colour straight from the tube, and mixed every one of the shades I used on the face. The more I painted, the more I got an understanding of how to get the colours I wanted. Throughout the mixing process, I compared the colour on my paintbrush to the one in the photo side by side to see if it matched or if I was still a bit off. I acquired a lot of knowledge from the videos I watched, like mixing a tiny amount of blue to make the skin less warm or adding yellow to make it less red. For the water, although I had also watched a few videos surrounded it, I followed my own instincts as well. After trying a few things, I developed a technique that I eventually used for the rest of the water in my painting. First, I would mix the colour I needed and laid it on the areas they appeared in in the photo. I wasn't too picky with the water process because nature is not perfect, and I just wanted to have the general look of water to not waste time either. The most important part was blending out the colour with a dry brush to get that smooth effect. I repeated this process throughout the entire painting. Although I did not have an intended message for this painting, I was certain that I wanted to convey the feeling of peace, freedom, and life, symbolized through the water. Universally, water serves as a symbol for life and freedom, and you could say that my painting is a celebration of those things. Essentially, I wanted to capture the general idea of being at ease with oneself and letting nature take its course. My other theme for this artwork was challenging myself and exploring my own artistic style. I believe that I am still in the process of discovering my creative style, and this was a big step towards finding that. I knew that I loved painting portraits, and that painting was something I've always wanted to try and master. Overall, I think I was a bit ambitious with the entire concept of my project, however, the water in particular served as a great challenge because of how hard it is to capture in a painting. Despite this, I decided to take a leap of faith, and I was motivated to try something I've never done before. The elements of the painting that ultimately helped me in conveying my intended mood was the realistic aspect of it. I knew that realism was something that I wanted to work towards in my artistic journey, and I think I did a good job of demonstrating that in the painting. I wanted the painting to be realistic because that's what I know I enjoy doing. This project essentially served as a huge learning opportunity for me to find my own personal style as an artist and learn a lot of valuable skills and techniques when it comes to oil painting. I think the theme of allowing us to create anything we wanted with any type of medium was an exciting opportunity for me to do something that I wanted to do, which ultimately affected my performance in the task and motivated me even more to make it the best it could be. I feel as though my initial intentions for this assignment were full-filled with the end result because I can proudly say that it came out exactly how I wanted it to. I wanted to stick to my style of realism, and picking up useful tips from videos and having patience helped me achieve this. With that being said, I am very happy with how the final piece turned out, and have learned so much during the process of making it. It was something that took up a lot of time and patience, however, it was worth it in the end to have created something that I was happy with. Moving forward, I want to continue with realism as well as painting with oil paints because of how much I enjoyed using them in this assignment.

                To start I began researching meanings behind it, and how I could incorporate them into something on a bigger scale. This was in part due to my fear of personalizing and expressing my emotions on a deeper scale.
                
                I decided to go with the feelings of depression and anxiety along with PTSD. This showed and expressed the meaning and feeling I wanted to portray and allowed for an explanation that was partially detached from my original intent.
                
                Starting the sketches were simple as the ideas had come to me straight from the start. having done this I began drawing on the tablet creating sketches and Identifying the different areas that needed to be looked at or would have some concern.
                
                The body seemed to need a lot of detail despite being a rather small piece of the puzzle. I enlarged it to allow for more detail and began drawing. The intersections between muscles, bone, and skin may have been a rather high concern, but the hip bone was the hardest one to draw and define. to concur with this I went over it countless times referring to bone structures, anatomy books, and internet pictures of different bones in different lighting.
                
                The muscles only required minimal detail and were shown by short sharp lines in high numbers. This proved effective and once learned made them a rather easy part.
                
                After completing the body I decided to make the character lookup with a blindfold which quickly proved challenging and required me to refer to our previous units' skills. Real-life drawing.
                
                This was not much of a challenge, unfortunately, as I completed the body the file got deleted and so I was back to square one.
                
                I was not deterred from completing this but had run into a wall as I had no idea what I was meant to do from there. I stayed clueless for a period of 3 days unsure of what to do or add.
                
                This was until I remembered that I could just express the very emotions that I felt as it occurred and so I began once again.
                
                Thankfully with knowing how to do it, the process of drawing the body was much faster. This allowed me to integrate things that I could not in the first piece such as smooth transitions from bone to muscle and skin, and completing the monster I would later on refer to as ET.
                
                The human having a glow that attracts evil almost in this case being E.T and The monster itself being almost translucent to show that our fears aren't as real as they seem to us.
                
                I would then come to draw a picture of a human body without a face, and only muscles and bones exposed. Behind this would be E.T surrounded by darkness and white smoke.
                
                The humanoid figure would be completely unsuspecting to the monster, much like I was to the possibility of it all failing. In relation to my original prompt the ignorance, we all have to the issues we contain inside us.

    Artwork(name: "Confidence", artist: "Carter Chartier", yearCreated: 2020, description: """
                While approaching my final culminating task, knowing this would be my final art project, I knew I had to make it the best I possibly could to finish my art career at LCS with a bang. The main theme I felt I could focus on for my project was confidence. With this in mind, I first analyzed my life to determine why I have felt confident in the past. This immediately made me think of my father and our relationship. Before any sporting event or school assessment I always remember he would ask “how you feelin?” and I would always say “I’m nervous” which he would respond with “good” considering he felt me being nervous just showed I cared. But then he would always end the conversation with “Just do what you do, and be confident”.
                
                Now was the time to decide what media to use, what to do in general, and how I would get the point of “Confidence” across to my audience. I ended up deciding on drawing a portrait because I genuinely felt drawing is my best use of media. I originally thought paint would be interesting although, my painting skills are not very good therefore I felt drawing was my safest route.
                
                Choosing who or what I wanted to draw really boggled my mind. My original plan was to draw Connor McGregor and Carey Price in the safe portrait, but I quickly realized that this would be near impossible in the time frame we were given, therefore, I quickly decided to only do Connor. I felt he displayed the confidence theme the best considering he is known worldwide for his trash talk, and ultimate confidence while in the octagon. He talks the talk and walks the walk, that is something I have always admired that about this athlete.
                
                During the process, some of my most successful parts included the right eye as well as the tattoo. The right eye was the first eye I targeted in this piece and I genuinely think it is the best feature of the piece. Using the 8B pencil I was able to develop an emphasis on the inner eye as well as the slight glare in the pupil. This gave an effect of lights being shined on Connor giving the stadium feel. My second favourite element was the tattoo. I felt it honestly looked very realistic and represented Connor’s chest very well.
                
                With this process came many annoying and rage-inducing moments as well. This included the left eye as well as the beard. The left eye was more than painful then the right considering I had to restart it four different times and did not finish with a product I was 100% confident with the final product. My second biggest challenge was the beard. It wasn’t exactly difficult but I had to darken it approximately three times and I had to re-do each strand of hair taking me an enormous amount of time. Although, I was happy with the final product.
                
                This project has taught me a lot about my skills and patients as an artist. I was genuinely happy with the end result and am very sad art is over. I felt this was the best project I could have finished my year with and I am excited to create more art in the future.

                In class we were assigned to create a piece of art, using whatever media we wanted. I chose to use oil paint to try and recreate a photo I took on the beach this summer. This was my proposal.
                
                I chose to use a graph to paint the beach because I have experience using one, and I feel it gives me more accurate proportions. I started to paint the background sky with acrylic pint.
                
                I added oil paint on top of the acrylic paint to help blend and paint the details. I started to paint in the forground adding details in the sand.
                
                Then I added the clouds, which were challenging to paint accurately, because when I blended them they would become bigger and not look accurate to the photo.
                
                I added in the details in the water, and changed up the clouds a bit, to soften the look of them and make them look a bit more realistic.
                
                In the final stage I added the details in the grass on the left, and created the suns reflection off the water.

    Artwork(name: "The Anxious Trees of an Overthinker", artist: "Ellie Murdock", yearCreated: 2020, description: """
                The art culminating project was presented as an opportunity to express any project media of choice. For this assignment I decided to try something new and make trees with wire. The idea was inspired by my love of metal working artists and the creativity that goes into sculpting. While on a trip to Vancouver, I met an artist that uses old metal pieces to weld them together and make new art pieces. I did not have experience or access to welding so I started with bending wire. Over time experimenting with different medias, I have found my passion for sculpting and working with my hands in a tactile way.
                
                Over the past year or so I have noticed a deep connection to trees and their beautiful structures in nature. Most of my recent works have revolved around the idea of trees and how they can describe me as a person.
                
                I am an over thinker therefore when I get good ideas, the end product is always different. For my wire trees there is variety in the shape of the trees, branches and the rocks they sit on. The colour of the leaves are only significant to the season they represent and the favourite colour of each of my family members. My dads tree is red, moms is blue, brothers is green and my tree has no leaves. The reasoning behind the lack of leaves on my tree was to resemble winter but also the fact that I grow and change every day just like the season.
                
                The anatomy of a tree is like the anatomy of me as a person. the leaves are wild and spread out all over the place reaching for the sky. This is a representation or my thoughts and goals, all over the place but still end back to the same place or origin. The tree trunk is like my core, the sturdy structure of my body. no matter how much people poke, prod and push, I still stand tall and proud of who I am. I am a very huggable person and when someone needs a helping hand or somewhere to go for comfort I am there. Last but not least is my roots. The roots are my morals and everything I stand for. Their strength keeps me grounded, holding me down to earth.
                
                The wooden table and board that all the trees sat on were not as significant but brought out the earthy feel the trees represented.

                As my project I decided to do a project about body image, specifically about eating disorders (anorexia). There are so many young women who suffer from the body image pressures that society has set for us. There is this one model that everyone should fit to in order to reach the beauty standards. This pressure causes young women to go to extreme measures to transform their bodies to that model.
                
                With my art piece I wanted to address this problem. The physical as well as psychological illnesses this kind of setting causes for young women all over the world is heartbreaking.
                
                This article is a big part of my inspiration. In the article it said that people who suffer from anorexia use multiple layers of makeup to hide it.

                This project was done for the school assignment "Gallery In The Grove", and I worked with a parter. We were not given any specific topics and we chose "racism".
                
                Our installation consists of 5 faces of different race stereotypes, essentially different ethnicities. All the panels together form a cube which represents all human beings in the world, it has rectangular edges instead of being a sphere like the earth because our world is not always so perfect. All brush strokes on the same panel have one hue with different variety of values and intensities. Each hue is the base colour of one skin colour. We wanted to create layers because of the complexity and depth of everyone’s culture and background. The eyebrows and eyes are carved out of the faces, but we can tell from their dramatic size and shape difference that the distinct features of each race. Straightforward, unembellished racist comments are written directly on to the canvas, with black sharpie markers. Their contents shouldn’t be the audiences’ focus. However, the sensation of how these bold fonts are ruining the beautiful painting underneath should arise in every individual's viewing experience.
                
                    
                
                There are two stages of this installation. When the light bulb is off, the viewers are able to see the skin colours and the typical unkind words that have been said to a specific group. When the light bulb is on, the outer appearance of these faces are dimmed by the light coming out from within, so are the comments that contain racism. Our artwork takes on the responsibility to stand up against racism, the main message is that our souls are all the same and equal. It also serves as a reminder to those who have been discriminated against before due to their races: as long as you have a light in your heart, it is bright enough to shine through the words that might have hurt you. What others think cannot drag you down or define who you are. We all have the strength to fight against those who don’t deserve you.

                I chose only acrylic paint for this artwork as well since there was only the paint in my home and I couldn't find oil paint with a reasonable cost and amount. The paint is called Turner Acryl Gounache and it's from Turner Colour Works LTD. And I specifically used white, black, cobalt blue, and sky blue from the package.
                
                For showing how my muscles or wrinkles are located and how those parts have undulation when I make a facial expression of confused, I used different colours. They are actually all based on blue but I used darker blue colours for parts shade and lighter blue colours for parts near the surface where the light reflects the most. When different colours come aside each other, I blended them. It was difficult doing this with acrylic paint since it got dried so quickly, so I also tried to work on blending as quick as I can.
                
                Since the artwork is showing a facial expression of CONFUSED and I thought wrinkles that would come up around eyebrows are a big key for people to see the person's emotion, so I emphasized wrinkles and shade around my eyebrow by using both dark and light colours.
                
                This artwork is used movement from the principles of art because the different blue colours describes my muscles pulled up and  compressed from the expression and it's a movement of the muscles. Also, gazing from the postmodern principles is used because the eye is looking straight at viewers.
                
                As I mentioned, the theme of this artwork is CONFUSED, so I chose blue for the base colour of this emotion.  I wanted to use a dark colour that gives viewers a little sense of negative and a word of "blue" is also used for describing a state of gloom or depression, so blue matches the best.
                
                There are a few points to improve, such as too white on the eyebrow and needed more wrinkles to paint. However, I feel it was successfully painted since the highlighted part on my eyelid and the reflected light in my eyeball are well described and the volume, amount, and thickness of my eyelash is painted perfectly. And also, it was a great chance to learn the characteristics of acrylic paint since I could experience the difficulty of blending colours.

    Artwork(name: "Happy", artist: "Hinako Hotta", yearCreated: 2020, description: """
                I used only acrylic paint for this artwork because it was only what I had at home for painting and couldn't find oil paint with a reasonable price and amount. I specifically used white, black, burnt sienna, and perm lemon.
                
                Since the paint gets dried very quickly and it was too thick for blending colours, I expressed contrast of shade and high parts around my eye by using multiple colours separately (without blending). The colours are based on a same colour as the base colour which is the light yellow and I made into a various thick or light colours by adding black, brown or white. For the parts located deeper from the surface of my face, I used darker colours based on the light yellow (base colour), brown, and black. And for the parts located higher from the surface, I used lighter colours based on the light yellow (base colour), brown, and white. For creating even more colours with different thickness, I changed the ratio of those simple colours and layered on. I started painting with the lightest colour, layered on darker colours, and finally painted my eyebrow, eyelash, some lines around or on my eyelid with the darkest colour.
                
                This artwork is showing an emotion of HAPPY and a facial expression of smiling. The eye I painted is actually me taken a photo thinking about something funny and smiling. With  some different colours, shapes, and lines, I described how the muscles around my eye lifted up or moved and how it is reflected the light.
                
                It is used movement and unity from the principles of art because the muscles have natural lines for the facial expression as a movement and different colours are united to form an eye. And gazing from the postmodern principles is used because the eye behind a narrowed eyelid and the eyelash is looking at viewers.
                
                Because the them of this artwork is HAPPY, I chose yellow as the base colour to express this emotion. I think this colour has a positive sense because it stands out well from darker colours and I see a lot of time that lights and sun are coloured in yellow when people's pictures or design.

                I chose just acrylic paint for this artwork because it was difficult to get oil paint for me at that time. I specifically used white, black, and sky blue.
                
                For this artwork, I used simple colours because there would be not many wrinkles or complex features when a person makes this facial expression. So I wanted only shades and top parts to be shown for describing how muscles and other parts get relax with no movement such as being pulled up or compressed. Also, I paid an attention for the eyeball part for for the eye to express BORED better. Since I wanted the eye to be looked like being in a daze, I painted the reflected view bigger in the black eye. By doing this, the eye is looked more zoned out and it gives viewers the emotion clear and strongly. And adding to those techniques, I also focused on the detail too. Because my skin has some freckles and obvious pores between my eyes and nose, so I painted them after painting everything.
                
                To convey this artwork is showing a facial expression of BORED, shape of the parts around my eye, selection and combination of colours, and some details were the keys.
                
                In this artwork, emphasis and unity from the principles of art are used. Because the light blue parts which is top parts that reflects the light well such as my cheek bone or other tissue stands out since it's painted with a light blue. And unity because thin and small hears gather in a shape to form eyebrow or eyelash. Also, gazing from the postmodern principles is used since the eye is looking at viewers.
                
                As the theme was BORED, my idea was to create a facial expression looked like inactive and tired, and I felt it should be tended to be negative mood but not too negative. So that's why I chose blue but also light blue in some parts and the whole artwork doesn't look completely negative.
                
                As a point to improve, I could use more colours to show more detail of the muscles or wrinkles around the eye. However, I'm feeling that this was done successfully since I personally like this colouring and how the reflected lights are painted. And it shows the expression well with the simple shapes and colours even though I didn't blend colours, so it doesn't look natural but realistic to the emotion.

    Artwork(name: "Teishoku", artist: "Hinako Hotta", yearCreated: 2020, description: """
                I chose paper clay and acrylic paint for the media of this project. I could use an actual clay made with soil but I didn't have kiln to bake, so paper clay was the best material I could find for creating this artwork at home. Paper clay gets dried so quickly, it turns to be very hard, and easy to get because the price is normally cheap. But instead, it is easy to break if you make it thinner or with some cracks on.
                
                I have a lot of experience using paper clay to create artworks when I was a kid but I hadn't touched clay for long since then, so I enjoyed creating this. But compared to my childhood, I struggled in some parts of the process because I was trying to make it more precisely and detailed in much smaller scale. First one was from quality of the clay that I used and its feature which is becoming hard quick, I had to think about a tip not to let the clay gets dried. So I used some water to keep the clay soft and make it smooth with no cracks. I prepared a cup of water and put some water on my hands and the pieces that I was working on every minute. Also, I kept a clay that I wasn't using in a plastic bag with a zipper for make sure it doesn't touch an air. Second one was that smaller or thinner pieces were easy to break. If the piece is larger and used a lot of clay, it would be hard like actual pottery but smaller pieces are fragile and light since it's made with paper. So I had to be really careful when I paint on the pieces. For example, Chinese chives on the main dish and grass noodles on a side dish were thin, so some of them were actually broken while painting. To fix this problem, I mixed a little bit of water with the paint. Because acrylic paint is thick, I wanted it to be lighter that I don't have to push hard when I paint on. The third one was that it was difficult to make the surface smooth. Because it's easy to get cracked and the clay is rough, I had to think carefully about how much water I should use, how much I can press without breaking it, and how much clay I should use for each piece. So while creating this artwork, I also focused on the temperature, humidity, and condition of the clay. And the fourth one is that there were always some spots that I couldn't complete painting because of the rough surface. Some of the pieces have holes or lines, so I used thinner paintbrush for make sure I paint the entire surface. In the process of creating this, I encountered some troubles or difficulties but I came through with these useful or helpful ideas.
                
                I believe this artwork was successfully done. It took about a week in total and I hadn't done using clay for long, so I could be always excited when I was going step by step. And there were actually some steps that I had never done, such as using some water and make clay soft and smooth, painting dried clay with acrylic paint, and creating something realistically. So it gave me a chance to be more creative and learn some techniques of using clay.

                I created one of my favourite meal with paper clay. This meal is a set meal in Japanese style and called teishoku. I often eat it when I go for a ski trip to Nagano (located in southern part of Japan) because the restaurant is located at bottom of the mountain. The staffs there are so warm and the meal gives me some energy, so I love it and its atmosphere.
                
                I chose teishoku not only because I love it. I believe Sushi is commonly known by a lot of people in the world as a Japanese food currently but most people don't know what teishoku is, so I also wanted everyone who sees this to know there are more different Japanese food that is delicious and healthy. (*You can learn what teishoku from the link below. Also you can know about the dishes on the tray from the link under it.)

    Artwork(name: "Maquette", artist: "Hinako Hotta", yearCreated: 2020, description: """
                In the proposal, I designed three sculptures in total following my message for people to realize how precious having friends or family they can support each other and they are not alone even though during this difficult time due to the pandemic. To convey the message by communicating with viewers through a sculpture, I chose its location to be in a park because park is where a various people come for different purposes. For examples, kids come for the playground and play with other kids, students come for chill or talk with friends, parents come for watching their kids and expand their community by being friends with other parents, and elder people come for exercise and seeing changing seasons in the nature such as trees and flowers. As I've actually seen these people using the park, I wanted a lot of people to see or use this sculpture and feel warm or have a peaceful mind. So finally, I chose the first sketch to create since the sculpture is the most eligible for my message. The first sculpture has two benches that people can sit and it makes more chance for people to interact with others if one sits on one and other sits on another one. Also, the design that two hands are holding the benches will make the situation better.
                
                I didn't put on the maquette but the actual sculpture will have two light on each side of the circle shaped parts and it will allow people to use it even though it's dark. And it will also have a role of a street light in the area.
                
                Because I made the maquette with paper, it was tough to make it three-dimensional. So I would like to correct some parts that wouldn't be same as the maquette. The hands will be more rounded and look more realistic, the circle parts would be sphere of ellipse and have a LED light on each side, and there wouldn't be the base with height and it would be on the ground.

                I chose using multiple different media because I thought it will help describing each images better and give some impact to viewers. At first, I was going to only use acrylic paint because I've used one for many times during this course. But I  also wanted to try using materials that I normally don't use or had never used before, so I finally decided to use 8 different of them in 9 different styles which are acrylic paint, coloured pencils, pencils, water colour, origami (coloured paper), pastel, juxtaposition+collage, and crayons.
                
                Through creating this artwork, I used some techniques that I knew and newly learned. For Window View From Airplane, painting clouds was a new skill that I learned. I used dried paintbrush and started with the lightest colour which is white for its shapes and added darker colours which are a few gray colours for the shades. And last, I added white again for each cloud's highlight points. For Kilauea Volcano, I painted in mosaic form because I had never created an art in this style and I thought it would be an excited challenging for me. I used a lot of different colours but in a small changing to try making the picture looks as smooth as it could be for viewers to know what the picture is showing. For End Of The Summer, I was confident with using colour pencils, so I tried to make it looks more realistic by using gradation for each pieces of plants or moss to show the darker and lighter parts. For Snowy Woods, I recalled the techniques I learned when I created my portrait last year and used the thin erasers and blending with tissue paper. For Fuji Mountain, I blended light orange,  yellow, and blue to show sky in the early morning and painted the reflected mountain with its edge being jiggly because it's on the surface of a lake. For Madarao, I tried not to miss any small parts or details because I knew it wouldn't look realistic if I cut them. By using scissors and a cutter, I cut out every single shades of the clouds and woods or path on the mountain. Like painting clouds with acrylic paint, I first glued lighter coloured pieces and put darker ones on top. For Katchewanooka Lake, I shove pastel and blended with my fingers. Because it's difficult to create a colour since it's not like painting, I used a various colours to show the gradation in the sky and on the surface of the lake. For Bay At Izu, I used cardboard, bubble wrap, supermarket flyer, toothpick, and a string to emphasize each parts. For example, the ocean is made with bubble wrap and a blue paper under it so express water, an orange is for sun to show it's freshness and energy, some chocolates are for houses to show their solidness, and tooth picks are for fences and a utility pole. For Cicada, I also focused on how the light is on the object and the floor covered with stones. The light is from right to left, so I put darker colours to show shades in left side of each pieces of stones and a cicada.
                
                This artwork is for viewers to realize the beauty of nature and the power that nature has. But at the same time, it's also for myself having some time reviewing memorable and beautiful moments from this year, so there're these two meanings in it and I believe its mood is relax, calmed, and sentimental.
                
                "Nature" is formed with these different elements or atmosphere and they create a good balance in the "nature". For creating the 9 different moments, I used informal balance, formal balance, rhythm, proportion, repetition, movement, and unity from the principles of art. And I used juxtaposition, recontextualization, and layering from the postmodern principles.
                
                Overall, I'm believing that my attempts were successful because I could go over 9 different styles of art. Some of them made me review and improve what I learned in the Grade 12 art course and some of them gave me some chance and time to explore my art skills and know how much I can do and how much I'm still green. At the same time, I could know what kind of art styles I love or I'm good at to express something. And by looking at my art and having a feeling of fulfillment, I could reaffirmed that the love and passion I have in my mind against art is pretty huge.

Because it's difficult to create a colour since it's not like painting, I used a various colours to show the gradation in the sky and on the surface of the lake. For Bay At Izu, I used cardboard, bubble wrap, supermarket flyer, toothpick, and a string to emphasize each parts. For example, the ocean is made with bubble wrap and a blue paper under it so express water, an orange is for sun to show it's freshness and energy, some chocolates are for houses to show their solidness, and tooth picks are for fences and a utility pole. For Cicada, I also focused on how the light is on the object and the floor covered with stones. The light is from right to left, so I put darker colours to show shades in left side of each pieces of stones and a cicada.
                
                This artwork is for viewers to realize the beauty of nature and the power that nature has. But at the same time, it's also for myself having some time reviewing memorable and beautiful moments from this year, so there're these two meanings in it and I believe its mood is relax, calmed, and sentimental.
                
                "Nature" is formed with these different elements or atmosphere and they create a good balance in the "nature". For creating the 9 different moments, I used informal balance, formal balance, rhythm, proportion, repetition, movement, and unity from the principles of art. And I used juxtaposition, recontextualization, and layering from the postmodern principles.
                
                Overall, I'm believing that my attempts were successful because I could go over 9 different styles of art. Some of them made me review and improve what I learned in the Grade 12 art course and some of them gave me some chance and time to explore my art skills and know how much I can do and how much I'm still green. At the same time, I could know what kind of art styles I love or I'm good at to express something. And by looking at my art and having a feeling of fulfillment, I could reaffirmed that the love and passion I have in my mind against art is pretty huge. It was a great project to challenge myself and know more about myself.

                For my culminating assignment, I created an artwork themed nature. I chose this theme because when I was thinking back on my memories this year, many of the beautiful views of nature either in Lakefield and here in Japan came up and I realized those views or atmosphere made me relax or feel better in my mind a lot during this difficult time. And I also wanted the viewers to know that the natural power that nature has, such as woods, mountains, lakes, and so on can heal people’s minds and reduce their concerns.
                
                Also, through this artwork, I wanted to express the beauty of nature. Since I love the outdoor, I had seen many different faces of it and each has its own fascination. For example, in summer, trees are green and everything sounds active. But in winter, the air sounds sharp but quiet from the cold weather and snow. To show the different seasons, time, and places, I chose 9 of my favourite moments and described in different materials, and elements.

                I chose using multiple different media because I thought it will help describing each images better and give some impact to viewers. At first, I was going to only use acrylic paint because I've used one for many times during this course. But I  also wanted to try using materials that I normally don't use or had never used before, so I finally decided to use 8 different of them in 9 different styles which are acrylic paint, coloured pencils, pencils, water colour, origami (coloured paper), pastel, juxtaposition+collage, and crayons.
                
                Through creating this artwork, I used some techniques that I knew and newly learned. For Window View From Airplane, painting clouds was a new skill that I learned. I used dried paintbrush and started with the lightest colour which is white for its shapes and added darker colours which are a few gray colours for the shades. And last, I added white again for each cloud's highlight points. For Kilauea Volcano, I painted in mosaic form because I had never created an art in this style and I thought it would be an excited challenging for me. I used a lot of different colours but in a small changing to try making the picture looks as smooth as it could be for viewers to know what the picture is showing. For End Of The Summer, I was confident with using colour pencils, so I tried to make it looks more realistic by using gradation for each pieces of plants or moss to show the darker and lighter parts. For Snowy Woods, I recalled the techniques I learned when I created my portrait last year and used the thin erasers and blending with tissue paper. For Fuji Mountain, I blended light orange,  yellow, and blue to show sky in the early morning and painted the reflected mountain with its edge being jiggly because it's on the surface of a lake. For Madarao, I tried not to miss any small parts or details because I knew it wouldn't look realistic if I cut them.

                For my culminating assignment, I created an artwork themed nature. I chose this theme because when I was thinking back on my memories this year, many of the beautiful views of nature either in Lakefield and here in Japan came up and I realized those views or atmosphere made me relax or feel better in my mind a lot during this difficult time. And I also wanted the viewers to know that the natural power that nature has, such as woods, mountains, lakes, and so on can heal people’s minds and reduce their concerns.
                
                Also, through this artwork, I wanted to express the beauty of nature. Since I love the outdoor, I had seen many different faces of it and each has its own fascination. For example, in summer, trees are green and everything sounds active. But in winter, the air sounds sharp but quiet from the cold weather and snow. To show the different seasons, time, and places, I chose 9 of my favourite moments and described in different materials, and elements.

    Artwork(name: "Bay At Izu", artist: "Hinako Hotta", yearCreated: 2020, description: """
                I chose using multiple different media because I thought it will help describing each images better and give some impact to viewers. At first, I was going to only use acrylic paint because I've used one for many times during this course. But I  also wanted to try using materials that I normally don't use or had never used before, so I finally decided to use 8 different of them in 9 different styles which are acrylic paint, coloured pencils, pencils, water colour, origami (coloured paper), pastel, juxtaposition+collage, and crayons.
                
                Through creating this artwork, I used some techniques that I knew and newly learned. For Window View From Airplane, painting clouds was a new skill that I learned. I used dried paintbrush and started with the lightest colour which is white for its shapes and added darker colours which are a few gray colours for the shades. And last, I added white again for each cloud's highlight points. For Kilauea Volcano, I painted in mosaic form because I had never created an art in this style and I thought it would be an excited challenging for me. I used a lot of different colours but in a small changing to try making the picture looks as smooth as it could be for viewers to know what the picture is showing. For End Of The Summer, I was confident with using colour pencils, so I tried to make it looks more realistic by using gradation for each pieces of plants or moss to show the darker and lighter parts. For Snowy Woods, I recalled the techniques I learned when I created my portrait last year and used the thin erasers and blending with tissue paper. For Fuji Mountain, I blended light orange,  yellow, and blue to show sky in the early morning and painted the reflected mountain with its edge being jiggly because it's on the surface of a lake. For Madarao, I tried not to miss any small parts or details because I knew it wouldn't look realistic if I cut them. By using scissors and a cutter, I cut out every single shades of the clouds and woods or path on the mountain. Like painting clouds with acrylic paint, I first glued lighter coloured pieces and put darker ones on top. For Katchewanooka Lake, I shove pastel and blended with my fingers. Because it's difficult to create a colour since it's not like painting, I used a various colours to show the gradation in the sky and on the surface of the lake. For Bay At Izu, I used cardboard, bubble wrap, supermarket flyer, toothpick, and a string to emphasize each parts. For example, the ocean is made with bubble wrap and a blue paper under it so express water, an orange is for sun to show it's freshness and energy, some chocolates are for houses to show their solidness, and tooth picks are for fences and a utility pole. For Cicada, I also focused on how the light is on the object and the floor covered with stones. The light is from right to left, so I put darker colours to show shades in left side of each pieces of stones and a cicada.
                
                This artwork is for viewers to realize the beauty of nature and the power that nature has. But at the same time, it's also for myself having some time reviewing memorable and beautiful moments from this year, so there're these two meanings in it and I believe its mood is relax, calmed, and sentimental.
                
                "Nature" is formed with these different elements or atmosphere and they create a good balance in the "nature". For creating the 9 different moments, I used informal balance, formal balance, rhythm, proportion, repetition, movement, and unity from the principles of art. And I used juxtaposition, recontextualization, and layering from the postmodern principles.
                
                Overall, I'm believing that my attempts were successful because I could go over 9 different styles of art. Some of them made me review and improve what I learned in the Grade 12 art course and some of them gave me some chance and time to explore my art skills and know how much I can do and how much I'm still green. At the same time, I could know what kind of art styles I love or I'm good at to express something. And by looking at my art and having a feeling of fulfillment, I could reaffirmed that the love and passion I have in my mind against art is pretty huge. It was a great project to challenge myself and know more about myself.

                In this series of paintings, I explore some of the most extreme expressions on human faces and try to amplify them with colours.
                
                    The top left painting represents shock and fear with a monochromatic colour scheme. The emotion is exaggerated with different shades of red. The bottom left painting expresses a sense of sadness with dark green, and the last one explores hesitation, anxiety and struggle. The purple colour makes it more mysterious.
                
                    The paintings are made on wood panels with a base of acrylic paint and oil paint on top to enhance details. The nature of oil paint makes it easy to blend therefore making the painting smooth while high in contrast.

                I acknowledge my hometown in this piece, where I came from is an important part of my self-identity.
                
                This artwork is made up of two separate pieces, inspired by my hometown, Shanghai. I used a photo I took at The Bund as the background and my headshot as the representative of my identity.
                
                For the piece on the right, first, I tried to print my headshot on a transparent paper and layer it on top of the photo, but they didn't blend in well. So I used software to combine these two and the result is satisfactory. I used all real photos in this piece because I want to reflect the reality of life. All the neon lights on the buildings make people feel energized, on the edge of over-whelming.
                
                For the one on the left, I used collage to replace the photo which adds a more abstract feeling to it, making it an idealized world. I chose different shades of blue and a touch of light yellow to create a calm yet exciting emotion. On top of the collage, I did a blind contour drawing to match the other piece, in an abstract way.

                This piece is called Nature because I want the audience to find their true-self in this piece. I used three of the same headshot in this piece which may seem receptive at a glance but each of them are unique in their own way.
                
                Counting from the left, the first part is the most blurry and shows the least amount of details. This represent the most organic part inside my head, the true nature of myself.
                
                The second part feels rough but you can identify a person's face from it. This is the middle ground of my identity.
                
                The third part is the most clear and is a full representation of myself. Putting three of the parts together shows the audience what really represents me and what I am made up of.
                
                All three parts are printed with the same piece. On the right is the original piece; the middle one is the first print and the left one is the last print which had the least amount of ink left, creating a rough texture.

This causes a constant unquenched thirst for more. Now although this can be a good thing, it can also be the cause of a lack of joy. This was expressed by using simply black color on this piece.

                Looking internally I realized I was far from the person I thought I was. I had created a  facade, a mask, put on a veil that was neatly decorated, and conformed to all the societal rules and expectations. I drew and painted a normal well detailed human face with all features that made one... attractive and fit in. Upon realizing this, I feared for what was behind, the truth behind years of work and structure. The pure and unadulterated me. I found something foreign yet familiar. I looked at it and saw the difference between the lie and the truth. Although different I could tell it was me. The true me that lied dormant for years. To express this I showed a pale face that matched the body, exposed cheekbones to show starvation almost ( represent being tucked away for a long time). And eyes, void-like, to express the depth the true self goes. Far from the stereotypical human face shape and style, this was because I don't believe there is one specific style or type of feature that makes us human. In knowing this I free myself from judging and fruitless judgment.

                After introspection, I noticed that despite all the things I did, created, or changed with myself, the veil removed and the true self is shown, I was still trapped. The things that happened to me and that I do are mostly out of my control. I felt like an observer giving the idea that I was just a head in a jar watching the events pass by me.
                
                At first, I wanted to dramatize this by incorporating colors that exposed it to be dramatic and painful. This is because that is how I believed others perceived it to be. A painful experience that should be hated and agonized about. THis is why I made the extremities and emphasized on making it look painful and used dramatic colors.
                
                After careful consideration, I realized that the ideas I had of how it should be was different from the reality of it. Everything outside seems to be nice and the inside which represents our thoughts is the only dark place. This is to signify the dark parts in our minds, thoughts and  feelings we experience. With all that it becomes muddled and dar. Thus the reason for the dark colours inside the Jar.
                
                Inately, we are normal and happy creatures. To express this I used many light and bright colors to show this also adding a slight smile. Unfortuntely we are constantly blinded by the world around us making everything seem darker than it actually is. To show this, I changed the eyes to pure black.

                This series required us to create three pieces. Two eyes and a nose. The process started with drawing out the eyes we had made which were relatively simple as we had sample pictures prior to starting. The only challenge would be showing the emotion in the drawings. This though proved easy enough and quite fun.
                
                The next required copying the drawing unto a wooden plate. This too was straightforward and quite simple.
                
                The point of this was to create an expressive piece that portrayed some form of emotion in great detail. After printing them onto the boards we'd cover the basic colors in acrylic paint to show our basic design on the expressions.
                
                Personally, painting is a challenge for me, and so this was very enjoyable and forced me to push my adaptation skills to their limits. My first acrylic painting had a great amount of detail which also took a lot of time leaving little for the other pieces. This made the other two a little more rushed but with the experience gained it was much easier. I made sample colors where needed to get an idea of the shades and transitions, kept it vague to allow for change later and let them sit and dry.
                
                The next and final step involved adding detail and all the extra things to make the piece look realistic. This was achieved with oil colors. There was no real purpose or intent behind anything done in the piece. I mainly wanted to attempt this new art style and see how proficient I am with it.

                This project was much easier to get started with than the rest, as in comparison, to the previous ones. During my time back home there has always been a snack that I'd eat whenever I can back home. This is something that I've greatly missed and so upon hearing the prompt, foods, This was the first thing that popped into my mind. Aloco. A food made from plantain that is native to my home country, Ivory Coast, and rather common in certain areas in Africa. Sometimes as a snack or a meal, regardless after moving from home I held on to it and so it is something rather special to me.

                For the base I wanted something I saw commonly in Ivory Coast. And Palm leaves was something greatly seen and used by people around the country. Some even wrapped their food in this. Taking this into account I decided to have the plate be a palm leaf. This was relatively challenging as I had to add the shape and design seen on real ones without an IRL reference leaving most to my imagination.
                
                To portray and give an understanding of what the food is and how it is made, I designed it in a way that shows the transition from start to finish. This was the plantain originally, followed by it being cut into pieces, and then once again smaller pieces until in a bowl and ready to consume.
                
                The challenge with this was not only making the pieces but mostly coming up with the idea. This was because to me simply making the food would not be enough and I needed the audience to know and delve deeper into the process of making this food.
                
                At first, I believed this would be a quick process but painting them proved to be a much longer process.  This was due to factors like; Inability to tell what color would look like after firing in the kiln, blending or showing an effective transition between the pieces.
                
                The final product after having encouuntered multiple issues with the kiln had come out rather successful.

                II knew I wanted to challenge myself t something I wasn't particularly good at but enjoyed and was determined to improve on. This led to the decision of using a graphic tablet to create the piece.
                
                The media used on the tablet were, Airbrush, Graphite, and Ink.
                
                I chose these because I believed they would best convey the feeling I was attempting to get across.
                
                This so far has been the hardest and most draining piece to make for me.
                ​
                The prompt was whatever we wanted and I had trouble finding something. I knew I wanted to express my emotions and bring to life the feelings evoked in me.
                
                To start I began researching meanings behind it, and how I could incorporate them into something on a bigger scale. This was in part due to my fear of personalizing and expressing my emotions on a deeper scale.
                
                I decided to go with the feelings of depression and anxiety along with PTSD. This showed and expressed the meaning and feeling I wanted to portray and allowed for an explanation that was partially detached from my original intent.
                
                Starting the sketches were simple as the ideas had come to me straight from the start. having done this I began drawing on the tablet creating sketches and Identifying the different areas that needed to be looked at or would have some concern.
                
                The body seemed to need a lot of detail despite being a rather small piece of the puzzle. I enlarged it to allow for more detail and began drawing. The intersections between muscles, bone, and skin may have been a rather high concern, but the hip bone was the hardest one to draw and define. to concur with this I went over it countless times referring to bone structures, anatomy books, and internet pictures of different bones in different lighting.
                
                The muscles only required minimal detail and were shown by short sharp lines in high numbers. This proved effective and once learned made them a rather easy part.
                
                After completing the body I decided to make the character lookup with a blindfold which quickly proved challenging and required me to refer to our previous units' skills. Real-life drawing.
                
                This was not much of a challenge, unfortunately, as I completed the body the file got deleted and so I was back to square one.
                
                I was not deterred from completing this but had run into a wall as I had no idea what I was meant to do from there. I stayed clueless for a period of 3 days unsure of what to do or add.
                
                This was until I remembered that I could just express the very emotions that I felt as it occurred and so I began once again.
                
                Thankfully with knowing how to do it, the process of drawing the body was much faster. This allowed me to integrate things that I could not in the first piece such as smooth transitions from bone to muscle and skin, and completing the monster I would later on refer to as ET.
                
                The human having a glow that attracts evil almost in this case being E.T and The monster itself being almost translucent to show that our fears aren't as real as they seem to us.
                
                I would then come to draw a picture of a human body without a face, and only muscles and bones exposed. Behind this would be E.T surrounded by darkness and white smoke.
                
                The humanoid figure would be completely unsuspecting to the monster, much like I was to the possibility of it all failing. In relation to my original prompt the ignorance, we all have to the issues we contain inside us.

    Artwork(name: "Change", artist: "Alana Kim", yearCreated: 2020, description: """
                Change is a piece that represents the change that comes with age. The media consists of graphite pencils on a 9 in x 8.5 in piece of paper. My simple choice of media was inspired from not wanting to take away from the message that is being portrayed with for instance vibrant colours, that would essentially distract from the focus. The monochromatic aspect of it, for me, plays a big part in setting a perhaps intense and dream-like mood. It is a portrait of me right now (15 years old), holding a mirror on one half of my face, while the other half is replaced with a reflection of my younger self. When you look into a mirror, you see yourself, however, a mirror can only tell so much about who you are, which applies to this drawing in the sense that although the girl in the mirror is me, it is not who I would consider myself to be as of this moment.
                
                This juxtaposition of my present self and my younger self was a more elaborate approach or illustration of how age and time make a difference in who you are, as I would not be able to recognize the person that I was last year or even 6 months ago. As humans, our instincts are to keep learning and changing to become better versions of ourselves and although the mirror can only identify physical change, it also symbolizes the radical difference in personality, behaviours, mentality, etc. that come with growth. Overall, I am happy with how this drawing turned out, and if I were to do it again, I would be more conscious of making the portrait look more accurate and maybe use a grid. While drawing I also realized that the paper was very textured, making it harder to make smooth shading and small details, therefore, using smoother paper would allow me to achieve softer shadows in both the face and background. Other than that, the finished product turned out to be what I envisioned it to be and what I was going for when I thought of the idea.

    Artwork(name: "Kimchi", artist: "Alana Kim", yearCreated: 2020, description: """
                Kimchi is an acrylic painting of kimchi that is meant to be a representation of cultural identity. During my creative process I envisioned this painting to be in colour and I thought that acrylic paint would be the best media to use to portray the vibrant colours of kimchi. I used patterned paper as placemats to incorporate a unique and different touch to the painting. When brainstorming about my identity, one of the things that I felt were important to my identity was culture. As a Korean-Canadian, connecting to my Korean heritage has always been a struggle, however one thing that has always linked me to my culture was food. Food has always been a significant aspect of every culture, and for me, it was the easiest way in which I could feel more connected to mine. Kimchi is a fundamental dish in Korean culture that I vividly remember eating growing up. My mom would make it in big batches for my family and I would eat it everyday at home. This represents the cultural aspect of my identity which I considered was a vital part of who I am that should be included in my "Windows Into My World" series. This was an exciting piece for me to work on because I was able to experiment with acrylic paint for the first time. I had always been hesitant to use it in the past because I didn't know how to use it, therefore I treated this as a learning experience. I learned new painting techniques through trial and error and how to use paint in order to achieve the look you are going for. This painting came out a lot better than I expected and I can say that I am proud of the end result. There is nothing about it that I desperately want to change or redo because in my opinion it came out looking quite accurate and the added touch of the patterned paper pulled the entire thing together.

    Artwork(name: "In My Mind", artist: "Alana Kim", yearCreated: 2020, description: """
                This piece is called In My Mind because, in a literal sense, it is revealing the inside of my mind. The portrait is drawn with coloured pencils while the shirt is comprised of magazine cutouts of a variety of flowers. The solid background is painted with watercolour and decorated with gold leaf. This was another one of my pieces that I wanted to be in colour because it pulls the drawing together. For instance, the use of blue for the face in the middle was essential in what message I wanted to set forth with this drawing. My intention for this artwork was to take a look into my mind and who I think I am on the inside, because there is so much more to someone than what is shown on the outside. I illustrated my head splitting in half down the middle to exhibit a 'second head' that represents my mind. I chose blue to represent my mind because if I were a colour, I think I would be blue. When you think of blue, you think of the sky or the sea; commonly calm things. Blue is also not a harsh colour; it's soft and, in a way, 'trustworthy' or 'approachable.'
                
                For this reason, I chose blue to symbolize the calm and collected way in which I carry myself and how others see me. The flowers covering my shirt are not only to add an interesting aspect to the drawing , but display my top VIA character strength: love. Flowers can symbolize a lot of things, but in this case, I used them to show my greatest strength of love, as flowers are often used as a token of appreciation. The specks of gold leaf in he background were just to add something that felt missing in the drawing, and I think were the perfect finalizing detail in this piece. This is one of my favourite artworks in the entire series because it is one of the coolest. My attempts to recreate what I had in my head for this were very successful in my opinion, and may have even exceeded my expectations for it. Specifically, I am very happy with how the colouring turned out and I feel as though the other media that was used worked well with each other.

    Artwork(name: "Missing", artist: "Alana Kim", yearCreated: 2020, description: """
                Missing is black and white piece that illustrates how other people see me. This was made by only using permanent marker to have a final monochromatic result. Through the lack of colour, my intention was to create an image that would reveal the least about myself. When you look at black and white photos they almost don't seem real and they are hard to imagine in real life. This is because the lack of colour, in a way, sucks the life out of the people in the photo. In a lot of ways, colour can reveal a lot about an image, and this is the exact opposite of what I was attempting to achieve through this artwork. I wanted to portray how others view me: a teenager, female, Asian, brown eyes, etc. When you see a missing persons poster, you get a brief description of their essential distinguishing traits , not who they are as human beings. I wanted to correlate this with how others see me, and what kind of person others think I am. Without saying anything about who I am as a person, I am able to get across the theme of how others see myself. One thing I would change about this artwork is printing out the words and numbers to achieve a cleaner look in general.

                This oil painting of an eye is called Curveball, which is in relation to the emotion it is portraying; surprise. This was painted with the assigned media of oil paint with a base of acrylic underneath. A usual response to shock is widening your eyes which is what I was trying to replicate in this piece. I made sure my eye was bigger than usual and that my iris was not touching the sides of my eye as well as my eyebrow being slightly higher and lifted to emphasize the emotion that is being displayed. When using oil paint, I wanted to avoid harsh lines and blend as much as I could to achieve the highest degree of realism I could. Finding the right colours for my skin tone was difficult at first however, through trial and error I believe I was able to get the different shades for the highlights and shadows right. What I was trying to show with this eye was the emotion of surprise, mostly portrayed through eye and how it is wider than usual. I chose to stick with the original shades of my skin primarily to maintain the focus on the eye. My interpretation of this theme was to create something realistic which I think was fulfilled with the colours and facial expressions. Overall, I would say that I am happy with the end result and utterly impressed with my paint job, as this was my first time oil painting and it was surprisingly a media that easy to work with, especially for blending. With that being said, When oil painting in the future, what I would keep in mind is blending and making sure the colours being used are accurate to the photo.

                Sadness was another emotion that I wanted to show in this collection because in my opinion, it is such a unique emotion that all humans experience one way or another. The Blues was somewhat a play on words to sadness but also the colour being used to represent it. Instead of bright or pastel blue, I specifically decided to make my shade range consist of primarily deep blues, dark purples, and subtle hints of red. The most obvious indicator of the emotion sadness is the teardrop cascading down my eye, however, in my opinion, the most powerful aspect of the painting is the precise use of colour. The dark blues and purples create a gloomy mood to the artwork, which may provoke a number of feelings to viewers, e.g.,sorrow, misery, grief, pain. On the other hand, my eyebrow is also curved slightly down while my eye is also drooped slightly down which help convey the message further. I believe that with the help of mostly colour choice as well as the tear and facial expressions were successful in portraying the intended emotion. In the future, I would love to pay around with different colours and how they can play a part in telling a message through an artwork.

                For my mouth painting, I wanted to showcase the emotion of disgust, hence the title Yuck. My idea to display disgust in the best way possible was using green as my main colour and sticking my tongue out. For some reason, our society has associated the colour green with the feeling of disgust which I think worked perfectly in this particular piece. Not only does the colour choice give away the theme of the painting, but the nose scrunching, and the tongue that sticking out with exaggeration. What I was going for with this piece was to just represent that specific feeling of when you accidentally eat something gross or just feel sick to your stomach for whatever reason. The green is supposed to provoke an uneasy feeling and the tongue sticking out further emphasizes the response of rejection. The end result of this painting turned out better that I hoped it would, and I think the green was a smart choice because in my opinion, it successfully bring out a queasy feeling that I was going for. However, what I could have done to make it even better was add more intricate details like small highlights or more small lines in the lips.

The purpose of this assignment was to create a plate of food that connected to our own individual lives, whether it connected to family, friends, or memories. In this project, food is used as a source of expression through trying to tell a story through a particular dish.

    Artwork(name: "Serenity", artist: "Alana Kim", yearCreated: 2020, description: """
                This piece is called Serenity. It is an oil painting on a 3ft by 2ft canvas. I decided to do an oil painting because it was a medium that I did not have much experience with, but wanted to try. The only time I had used oil paint in the past was in a previous assignment where we painted facial expressions on wooden panels. After that, I wanted to continue practicing with with it because of how much I loved the consistency and how easily they blended with each other. However, before starting the painting process, I made sure to watch videos about painting with oil paint in order to pick up some valuable tips before getting started so that I could get a deeper understanding of how to successfully work with the medium. I mainly focused on how to mix skin tones as well as how to accurately paint water. Painting water was something that I had never done before therefore, for me, it was crucial that I had at least some knowledge on how to do it beforehand. Ultimately, this preparation helped me become more confident in what I was doing and I managed to apply a lot of what I learned into my work. During the painting process, I learned a lot along the way about oil paint and what techniques work the best for certain things. Overall, I treated this process as a learning experience that took trial and error and a lot of patience. The biggest advice I would give for using oil paints is to blend, but also take the time to analyze your reference photo to know what colours to use and know how to mix them. The face was the most stressful part because I wanted it to look as realistic as possible. I rarely ever used the colour straight from the tube, and mixed every one of the shades I used on the face. The more I painted, the more I got an understanding of how to get the colours I wanted. Throughout the mixing process, I compared the colour on my paintbrush to the one in the photo side by side to see if it matched or if I was still a bit off. I acquired a lot of knowledge from the videos I watched, like mixing a tiny amount of blue to make the skin less warm or adding yellow to make it less red. For the water, although I had also watched a few videos surrounded it, I followed my own instincts as well. After trying a few things, I developed a technique that I eventually used for the rest of the water in my painting. First, I would mix the colour I needed and laid it on the areas they appeared in in the photo. I wasn't too picky with the water process because nature is not perfect, and I just wanted to have the general look of water to not waste time either. The most important part was blending out the colour with a dry brush to get that smooth effect. I repeated this process throughout the entire painting. Although I did not have an intended message for this painting, I was certain that I wanted to convey the feeling of peace, freedom, and life, symbolized through the water. Universally, water serves as a symbol for life and freedom, and you could say that my painting is a celebration of those things. Essentially, I wanted to capture the general idea of being at ease with oneself and letting nature take its course. My other theme for this artwork was challenging myself and exploring my own artistic style. I believe that I am still in the process of discovering my creative style, and this was a big step towards finding that. I knew that I loved painting portraits, and that painting was something I've always wanted to try and master. Overall, I think I was a bit ambitious with the entire concept of my project, however, the water in particular served as a great challenge because of how hard it is to capture in a painting. Despite this, I decided to take a leap of faith, and I was motivated to try something I've never done before. The elements of the painting that ultimately helped me in conveying my intended mood was the realistic aspect of it. I knew that realism was something that I wanted to work towards in my artistic journey, and I think I did a good job of demonstrating that in the painting. I wanted the painting to be realistic because that's what I know I enjoy doing. This project essentially served as a huge learning opportunity for me to find my own personal style as an artist and learn a lot of valuable skills and techniques when it comes to oil painting. I think the theme of allowing us to create anything we wanted with any type of medium was an exciting opportunity for me to do something that I wanted to do, which ultimately affected my performance in the task and motivated me even more to make it the best it could be. I feel as though my initial intentions for this assignment were full-filled with the end result because I can proudly say that it came out exactly how I wanted it to. I wanted to stick to my style of realism, and picking up useful tips from videos and having patience helped me achieve this. With that being said, I am very happy with how the final piece turned out, and have learned so much during the process of making it. It was something that took up a lot of time and patience, however, it was worth it in the end to have created something that I was happy with. Moving forward, I want to continue with realism as well as painting with oil paints because of how much I enjoyed using them in this assignment.

                While approaching my final culminating task, knowing this would be my final art project, I knew I had to make it the best I possibly could to finish my art career at LCS with a bang. The main theme I felt I could focus on for my project was confidence. With this in mind, I first analyzed my life to determine why I have felt confident in the past. This immediately made me think of my father and our relationship. Before any sporting event or school assessment I always remember he would ask “how you feelin?” and I would always say “I’m nervous” which he would respond with “good” considering he felt me being nervous just showed I cared. But then he would always end the conversation with “Just do what you do, and be confident”.
                
                Now was the time to decide what media to use, what to do in general, and how I would get the point of “Confidence” across to my audience. I ended up deciding on drawing a portrait because I genuinely felt drawing is my best use of media. I originally thought paint would be interesting although, my painting skills are not very good therefore I felt drawing was my safest route.
                
                Choosing who or what I wanted to draw really boggled my mind. My original plan was to draw Connor McGregor and Carey Price in the safe portrait, but I quickly realized that this would be near impossible in the time frame we were given, therefore, I quickly decided to only do Connor. I felt he displayed the confidence theme the best considering he is known worldwide for his trash talk, and ultimate confidence while in the octagon. He talks the talk and walks the walk, that is something I have always admired that about this athlete.
                
                During the process, some of my most successful parts included the right eye as well as the tattoo. The right eye was the first eye I targeted in this piece and I genuinely think it is the best feature of the piece. Using the 8B pencil I was able to develop an emphasis on the inner eye as well as the slight glare in the pupil. This gave an effect of lights being shined on Connor giving the stadium feel. My second favourite element was the tattoo. I felt it honestly looked very realistic and represented Connor’s chest very well.
                
                With this process came many annoying and rage-inducing moments as well. This included the left eye as well as the beard. The left eye was more than painful then the right considering I had to restart it four different times and did not finish with a product I was 100% confident with the final product. My second biggest challenge was the beard. It wasn’t exactly difficult but I had to darken it approximately three times and I had to re-do each strand of hair taking me an enormous amount of time. Although, I was happy with the final product.

After a long time of Hand-Building I started making what would be the toppings of the sope, such as beans, meat and cheese. The most difficult thing was to make the plate, because the plate was not completely stable and was not on a flat surface which means that the plate was not flat enough.

                This section of my project shows butterflies, clouds, and book paper The purple butterflies are handmade. Around the world, people view the butterfly as representing endurance, change, hope, and life. Butterflies are very symbolic to me as I have been through a lot of changes in my life that make me who I am. Through the lowest points in my life, I have endured change and learned hope. A simple object reminds me to keep pushing and that change is okay. This aspect of myself has been represented by an acrylic painting of a butterfly that drew with art pencils. I laid the butterflies on a collage of book scraps that were brushed with coffee so that the paper would appear old. This represents me being an Old-soul. Also, my love of literature.
                
                I have made this aspect of the piece very intricate and whimsical. I took a creative risk and used real flowers and dirt in which I pressed into a glued bristol board. The flowers took the longest time as it was quite trial and error, Ironing and using the printing press was a setback until a very lovely peer inspired me with a suggestion to microwave the flowers. Into the dirt, I have made root-like figures using paper maché - which will now lead to what this means to me. I am a very spiritual person and I stay true to my values. In a way, I stay true to my roots and my family. My family has been the most important thing to me for as long as I have remembered. My roots will always stay with me as I blossom and grow like a flower. I included the sky using layered tissue paper. The blue sky represents happiness and peace. Both that I have always tried to make a goal out of.

                This first panel of my project is called "Gloomy." This piece represents the emotions ourselves as humans feel so often in our lives. Sadness, depression, anxiety, etc. It's a normal feeling. I recreated this emotion through my own facial features. This was my first panel that I started on, so I focused alot on detailing through shadows and fine lines to create a sad look to the eye. The colour choice was very simple for me, this helped me mix the right colours to emphasize shadowing and highlights around my eye. In this part of the project I learned how to enhance my knowledge of facial realism in art. I was taught how to create fine hairs in my eyelashes and eyebrow. Although this was difficult I pushed through this obstacle with practice and dedication.
                
                This panel of my artwork was my second part of the project. It is called the “Evil eye.” The name represents jealousy in human beings. The evil eye is technically a form of extreme jealousy. This eye in particular looks frightening, although it wasn’t my aim at first, I took a creative risk. I wanted to emphasize this emotion in my color choice. I chose deep reds and harsh tones of brown and orange. I used cool tones to bring out the eyeball. I worked hard to perfect the techniques I learned from “Gloomy” including shadows, highlights, and some forms of realism. Using a fine brush I created wrinkle lines to amplify the emotion from my face.
                
                My final panel is called “Unique” This is my own smile, so the name is perfectly fitting. Every laughter is unique so I chose to paint my own. This was the hardest part of the project. At first, I was unhappy with my color choice, however - I learned that shadowing and highlight can bring a painting to life. I decided to stick with the yellow base I chose, as it represents happiness and laughter. I moved on to pick warmer tones to compliment the yellow. As I was finishing this panel I noticed the drastic improvement in the skills I had from my very first eye. This was a great accomplishment for me and my proudest painting as I incorporated my skills from self-portrait drawings into oil paint.

                I used various tools when working with clay. As this was my first time using clay, I learned a lot about this medium and how to make it work as effectively as possible. I started with a pretty good idea of what a wooden platter might look like, I used a knife to make details that would represent wood curves. I then rolled out different sizes of clay to start making my sushi. I would say the hardest part was making each piece hollow. It definitely took a few tries to get a fairly good piece of sushi. I found that by using different tools I could get texture. I had a clear image of my regular order at a sushi place I go to and I created different pieces with the clay.
                
                When experimenting with different textures, I used many tools to create the effects of sushi. I used a fork to press down lines on the salmon and create the detailing that raw fish usually has. For the noodles, I used a tool that I had never used before. I was amazed at what it could do as I could never roll it out myself. When it got fired in the kiln it came out as a hard bisque. I then had to choose colours. I chose colours that are best associated with sushi. From the seaweed to the wasabi I tried to nail the colours down so it looked as realistic as possible!

                My thesis most represents the Essential Question of “When we are exposed to another perspective of a story, specifically, a marginalized voice, what happens to our perception of narrative? I have created a portrait of a Mughal dancer. Many may not know who that is, which is one of the reasons it was of main interest to me. I chose to draw and paint a Mughal woman based on my readings of the early Mughal period where violence within women was a norm. The Mugal Empire also known as the Mogul Empire controlled much of South Asia between the 16th and 19th centuries for countries that include Pakistan and India. This was a time period where the oppression of women was based on the violent patriarchy that fell into this empire. “In South Asia, the ongoing prevalence of violence against women is associated with the region’s cultural involvement of patriarchal norms” (Nadia Abramason)  As the Mugahl rule slowly started to fade, women who were called “Tawaifs” would dance for the emperors. Dancing and music was very prominent for entertainment for the men. However, it was entirely controlled. Although times have drastically changed Mughal’s patriarchal rule continues to impact societal perceptions of women, specifically Pakistani women in the post-colonial era. I wanted to shed light on this sort of representation that can be overshadowed by the media. This marginalization comes from a culture that has been deeply ingrained into South Asia.

                I started on a 24X36 canvas that I stretched out by myself. Using Acrylic paint I started with an orange base, which I would later find out to be a huge mistake. The orange base was way too bright of an undertone for my painting, so I had to Gesso over it and restart. I felt really discouraged, especially when some of the colour was seeping through the white paint. I was the last person to finally start my artwork. Although this was a setback, I decided to keep going. Using acrylic and oil paint, I have created a portrait of a Mughal dancer. This has been a few weeks worth of progress and it's coming along great. I sketched out a woman with features of a Mughal woman. I was inspired by the vibrant colours that the Pakistani and Indian culture held and still holds  in their traditional garments, (which are very similar) however - to connect my work to the leading thesis, I chose bright red undertones for her outfit and a dark background. The red colours symbolize violence, but they are most symbolic through brush strokes which are free. The brush strokes create an illusion of movement. The overall painting is an image of movement and the brush strokes heavily symbolize that. Through the violence, she is still dancing in a beautiful dress. The intensity of the colours contributes to the intensity of the patriarchal violence towards women.
                
                During my research period for my Independent project in Visual Arts, I wanted to primarily focus on women’s marginalization and embracing womanhood from a different culture. My thoughts at first, were to create a portrait of an Indigenous woman primarily because I knew that this specific marginalized voice was a voice that I wanted to bring to light. This was a project idea that required me to think about my boundaries in a story that isn’t mine to tell. I knew that this was a difficult task to do in a short amount of time, but I still wanted to see what I could learn from this part of the creative process. In that same week, after speaking with Ms. Brown (my AP English teacher) she kindly allowed me to incorporate my art project into my english assignment. She encouraged me to explore with what I could do by reaching out to people who could help me. Following that conversation, I set up a meeting with Peterborough artist Tia Cavanagh, and we talked for what felt like minutes because I absorbed so much of her perspective as an Indigenous woman. After much consideration I decided that it would be beneficial for me to be as creative as possible with my own ethnic background. That way, I wouldn’t have to have the constant worry of pushing a boundary. That conversation with Tia was an integral part of my creative process, because it made me realize that in some form I want to pursue my learning about the Indigenous culture, the art, and the degrees of marginalization from someone who knows very little. Tia helped me find my creative style as an artist from colours to topics.  As passionate as I am about women’s rights, and learning about oppression within different cultures, I knew it would be interesting to learn more about my own roots as well. So much of it has been forgotten, and almost eliminated due to modern day society.

                The media we used was assigned and it was interesting to try oil painting for the first time. It wasn't as hard as I had originally thaught. It took a lot of blending and patience, sometimes it took forever for the paint to dry and sometimes it dried too fast. Making a soft finish was really hard but it got easier when I found the right way and direction to do the brush strokes. Hardest part was to keep the two opposite colors from mixing too much and creating a brown color.
                
                I chose these emotions just because they are the main ones everyone uses in their daily lives. Also the reason I chose happy for the mouth is that it's so much easier to smile with your mouth than your eyes. I wanted to make that apparent in my artwork. Also using the tear has been a theme in my works lately, so I just wanted to continue using it.
                
                The colors each are somehow connected to the emotion chosen. Usually red is connected with being angry or irritated and so on, sad is blue and happy is yellow.

                Our Visual art class and other class came together to create an idea of a sculpture made of paddles. We divided into groups and every group had to pitch an idea of a paddle installation.
                
                All students voted for an idea they liked the best and wanted to start making. After deciding we started to paint the paddles (1 or 2 each student) in different triangle patterns designed by students and then painted with different shades of one assigned colour.

                As my project I decided to do a project about body image, specifically about eating disorders (anorexia). There are so many young women who suffer from the body image pressures that society has set for us. There is this one model that everyone should fit to in order to reach the beauty standards. This pressure causes young women to go to extreme measures to transform their bodies to that model.
                
                With my art piece I wanted to address this problem. The physical as well as psychological illnesses this kind of setting causes for young women all over the world is heartbreaking.

                For this assignment we were asked to use oil paint to represent an expressive emotion. Starting out with a sketch, we progressed throughout the project basing the style on the type of art that suits the artist. I personally chose to be open to different styles and techniques as I went along. In the blue and yellow painting I used two colours that are on the opposite side of the colour wheel. I chose to represent the emotion of fear using the blue as an icy cold colour as circulation leaves the face. In the red painting I chose to show anger and use red the represent a fuming face. The strokes of the brush make a smooth realistic feel next to the harsh creases in the face. In the yellow painting, joy and happiness was the emotion. Using a darker yellow around the defined parts of the face I was able to create depth as if there were shadows. the red lips were intended to draw the viewers attention to the smile as smiles are happy and contagious.
                
                For this project the overall theme was the intensity that each emotion brought. Although none of these works have anything in common, they still get a message across about each emotion without having prior knowledge.
                
                I enjoyed this type of material of art in that although I wasn't familiar with oil paints, I still enjoyed trying something knew. there are many aspects of each work I really enjoy but also parts I could still critic. in the end I am happy with the turn out and the final product.

    Artwork(name: "Windows Into My World", artist: "Ellie Murdock", yearCreated: 2020, description: """
                Windows to my world was an assignment to express you and your personality throughout images no smaller  than 6x6. The first image shown is of a wave painted on a rock. The wave was painted to represent  how each day I just go with the flow rolling over with my big personality and ended with a calm, smooth and comforting sound. The reasoning behind the wave on the rock is that when I travel I always know that no matter where I am, I'm always connected to home by the land and ocean.
                
                The image of the Claddagh signifies my Irish family background and the three morals I live by. Loyalty, Love and Friendship have always been so important in my life. Most of this model was made 3D because of my artistic choice to have volume in my art. The crown is jewels as each person I am loyal to is a solid stone in my life. the hands are transparent because I am true and clear about who I my friends are and how significant they are to me. the heart is a celtic knot because although I am loved and love many things, I can often be closed off and let my heart sparkle as often as I can.
                
                The next image is a tree and represents me as a whole. the one side is very abstract background and thread outlining the tree. This side of me is complicated and all over the place but no matter how you look at it, as a whole it makes sense. The other side is more basic and flows as it is painted. this is the chill side of me that flows with whatever is thrown at me. the roots of the tree are not showing because they represent how grounded I am. although people can't see deep down who I am, my past and my morals drive me through each day
                
                The last image is three slices of lemons. "When life gives you lemons, add some sugar and water and make lemonade". My drive toward making this art was based off this quote. No matter what is thrown at me I always try to make the best of it by turning sour into sweet. the centre of the lemon is made of tissue paper making is slightly transparent. this material was used because often if I am in a tough situation I share half the information but use my sweetness to see the positive.

                We began in groups of two to think of ideas on how we were going to put together 40 painted paddles into one or more sculptures. My group came up with the idea to paint country flags from around the world on the paddle head and attach the paddles in a way that looks like a circular ball. we then would add a wire outline of each country and place it on top to create a visual that made all the paddles into a globe. to me this is what LCS represents, our diversity and equality.
                
                After a section vote, the concluding sculpture was decided to be The Hanging Canoe. As described on artists slide their idea was said "A big part of Lakefield is keeping traditions alive, while still advancing and modernizing with the passing of time. A canoe is a traditional form of transportation, and paddling is a big tradition in our school. As we design the canoe with a modern style, is demonstrates the merging of old and new. Growing and developing in the modern world while still staying true to our roots."

    Artwork(name: "Meals at the Sugar Bush", artist: "Ellie Murdock", yearCreated: 2020, description: """
                The pottery project was a hands on assignment working with molding clay into the most realistic meal you can, to be dried, glazed and fired in the kiln.
                
                The basis of this assignment was to create a meal that was significant to you, your culture or reminded you of a good time or occasion. I personally chose to make weiners and beans with chips on the side, placed on a paper plate. to anyone else this meal is simple and typically seen as comfort food but to me it's so much more. Every year my family and I open up our sugar shack in March and produce maple syrup till the seasons end. this has always been a special time as it's a community event that we can share with our friends and family. A typical day at the sugar bush would have over 20- 50 people rotating throughout the day coming in and out. For this number of people it's hard to feed so my family would cook up a quick pot of weiners and beans on the open shed wood fire mixed with some of the freshly boiling maple syrup. The simplicity of the meal makes it easy to make but also brings everyone together as they wait by the fire for their food. Another significant part of the project was the placement of the food on a paper plate.  In many art projects leaving white space has a very negative affect but in this specific work it was intentional. The weiners and beans were perfectly placed to the one side while the chips on the other. Besides this moment of 0.5 seconds the plate is made to perfect like it could be on a cooking show. There was irony in the placement because nothing at the sugar bush is perfect and everything is always chaotic. The drizzle of syrup coming from the weiners and beans is the start of everything. Around the chaos is so much smiles and laughter as we chat away. The stories we tell and the lessons we learn within this time are so valuable yet not noticed in the moment. the chips however have the similar affect as we know we will always go back for seconds. Once people truly dive deep into the experience in front of them they never want to leave or when they do they want to come back. A meal can be so simple but when explained can mean so much. This is why I chose weiners and beans based on the affect it has had on my life.

    Artwork(name: "The Anxious Trees of an Overthinker", artist: "Ellie Murdock", yearCreated: 2020, description: """
                The art culminating project was presented as an opportunity to express any project media of choice. For this assignment I decided to try something new and make trees with wire. The idea was inspired by my love of metal working artists and the creativity that goes into sculpting. While on a trip to Vancouver, I met an artist that uses old metal pieces to weld them together and make new art pieces. I did not have experience or access to welding so I started with bending wire. Over time experimenting with different medias, I have found my passion for sculpting and working with my hands in a tactile way.
                
                Over the past year or so I have noticed a deep connection to trees and their beautiful structures in nature. Most of my recent works have revolved around the idea of trees and how they can describe me as a person.
                
                I am an over thinker therefore when I get good ideas, the end product is always different. For my wire trees there is variety in the shape of the trees, branches and the rocks they sit on. The colour of the leaves are only significant to the season they represent and the favourite colour of each of my family members. My dads tree is red, moms is blue, brothers is green and my tree has no leaves. The reasoning behind the lack of leaves on my tree was to resemble winter but also the fact that I grow and change every day just like the season.
                
                The anatomy of a tree is like the anatomy of me as a person. the leaves are wild and spread out all over the place reaching for the sky. This is a representation or my thoughts and goals, all over the place but still end back to the same place or origin. The tree trunk is like my core, the sturdy structure of my body. no matter how much people poke, prod and push, I still stand tall and proud of who I am. I am a very huggable person and when someone needs a helping hand or somewhere to go for comfort I am there. Last but not least is my roots. The roots are my morals and everything I stand for. Their strength keeps me grounded, holding me down to earth.

Research shows that the strongly contrasting colours we see in the work today are the result of discolouration over the years. The walls and doors, for instance, were originally purple rather than blue. The apparently odd angle of the rear wall, meanwhile, is not a mistake on Van Gogh’s part – the corner really was skewed. The rules of perspective seem not to have been accurately applied throughout the painting, but this was a deliberate choice. Vincent told Theo in a letter that he had deliberately ‘flattened’ the interior and left out the shadows so that his picture would resemble a Japanese print.

When several of these works were exhibited in Paris that fall, the public and critics found the palette startling and ridiculed their efforts. As Derain later recalled, “Fauvism was our ordeal by fire.... It was the era of photography. This may have influenced us, and played a part in our reaction against anything resembling a snapshot of life. No matter how far we moved away from things ... it was never far enough.

    Artwork(name: "Estaque", artist: "André Derain", yearCreated: 1905, description: "The painting done by Andre Derain speaks clearly of the movement it dwells in for the following very many reasons. The identity of a Fauve painting was predominantly through the use of bright colors which is very vivid in this particular piece. The colors are not only vibrant and attractive but also are used in complementary pairs of colors from the color wheel. The colors incorporated are oranges with blues and reds with greens. This color contradiction is highlighted all throughout the painting with the orange tree trunks and multi-colored leaves with colors from blue-green-red. The painting the Turning road is a landscape so the forms of the structure are differentiated with the use of color as there is no outlining and fine strokes. Infact Andre Derain has used broken brush strokes that are swift and flat daubs of color as his painterly style of expressing his emotions behind the painting. The piece when viewed from a distance with squinted eyes would appear like a collage of colorful shapes put together in one frame.The painting has figures in lower half of it but just like the figures in Henri Matisse’s Joy of Life, they are elongated and disproportionate. the facial features are not present and the only way one can see or notice the difference between the gender’s would be through the way their clothes take shape on the bodies. Every figure in the painting is headed towards the big blue path which is the river. The way the trees curve with the path emphasize the meaning behind the title.

He was focused on studying the use of lines, the interaction between shadow and light, and the creation of perspective. Vasarely once affirmed: “The celebrated transition from the representational to nonrepresentational art is only one of the stages of profound transformation taking place in the plastics arts.

The Shot Marilyns is a work of art produced in 1964 by Andy Warhol. It consists of four canvases, each a square measuring 40 inches and each consisting of a painting of Marilyn Monroe, each shot through in the forehead by a single bullet.

Warhol actually painted five colored Marilyns in 1964 with different colored backgrounds: red, orange, light blue, sage blue, and turquoise. He stored them at The Factory, his studio on East 47th Street in Manhattan. Dorothy Podber (1932–2008), a friend of Factory photographer Billy Name, saw the recently completed paintings stacked against one another at the studio and asked Warhol if she could shoot them. Believing that she meant she wanted to photograph the paintings, Warhol agreed. Podber doffed her pair of black gloves, withdrew a small revolver from her purse, and fired a shot into the stack of four "Marilyn" paintings, which became known as The Shot Marilyns. The fifth painting with the turquoise background was not in the stack.

Billy Name, in the Ray Johnson documentary How to Draw a Bunny, describes this event as a "performance piece" by Podber. After she had shot the Marilyns and left, Andy Warhol purportedly asked Billy Name to please ask Dorothy not to do that again. Podber was, however, henceforth barred from The Factory for life.

Campbell's Soup Cans is a work of art produced between November 1961 and March or April 1962 by American artist Andy Warhol. It consists of thirty-two canvases, each measuring 20 inches (51 cm) in height × 16 inches (41 cm) in width and each consisting of a painting of a Campbell's Soup can—one of each of the canned soup varieties the company offered at the time. The non-painterly works were produced by a screen printing process and depict imagery deriving from popular culture and belong to the pop art movement.

Warhol was a commercial illustrator before embarking on painting. Campbell's Soup Cans was shown on July 9, 1962 in Warhol's first one-man gallery exhibition in the Ferus Gallery of Los Angeles, California curated by Irving Blum. The exhibition marked the West Coast debut of pop art. The subject matter initially caused offense, in part for its affront to the technique and philosophy of the earlier art movement of abstract expressionism. Warhol's motives as an artist were questioned. Warhol's association with the subject led to his name becoming synonymous with the Campbell's Soup Can paintings.

Warhol produced a wide variety of art works depicting Campbell's Soup cans during three distinct phases of his career, and he produced other works using a variety of images from the world of commerce and mass media. Today, the Campbell's Soup cans theme is generally used in reference to the original set of paintings as well as the later Warhol drawings and paintings depicting Campbell's Soup cans. Because of the eventual popularity of the entire series of similarly themed works, Warhol's reputation grew to the point where he was not only the most-renowned American pop art artist, but also the highest-priced living American artist.

The origins of art history can be traced back to the Prehistoric era, before written records were kept. The earliest artifacts come from the Paleolithic era, or the Old Stone Age, in the form of rock carvings, engravings, pictorial imagery, sculptures, and stone arrangements.

Art from this period relied on the use of natural pigments and stone carvings to create representations of objects, animals, and rituals that governed a civilization’s existence. One of the most famous examples is that of the Paleolithic cave paintings found in the complex caves of Lascaux in France. Though discovered in 1940, they’re estimated to be up to 20,000 years old and depict large animals and vegetation from the area.

Ancient art was produced by advanced civilizations, which in this case refers to those with an established written language. These civilizations included Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and those of the Americas.

The medium of a work of art from this period varies depending on the civilization that produced it, but most art served similar purposes: to tell stories, decorate utilitarian objects like bowls and weapons, display religious and symbolic imagery, and demonstrate social status. Many works depict stories of rulers, gods, and goddesses.

One of the most famous works from ancient Mesopotamia is the Code of Hammurabi. Created around 1792 B.C., the piece bears a Babylonian set of laws carved in stone, adorned by an image of King Hammurabi—the sixth King of Babylonia—and the Mesopotamian god, Shabash.

The Middle Ages, often referred to as the “Dark Ages,” marked a period of economic and cultural deterioration following the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 A.D. Much of the artwork produced in the early years of the period reflects that darkness, characterized by grotesque imagery and brutal scenery. Art produced during this time was centered around the Church. As the first millennium passed, more sophisticated and elaborately decorated churches emerged; windows and silhouettes were adorned with biblical subjects and scenes from classical mythology.

This period was also responsible for the emergence of the illuminated manuscript and Gothic architecture style. Definitive examples of influential art from this period include the catacombs in Rome, Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, the Lindisfarne Gospels, one of the best-known examples of the illuminated manuscript, and Notre Dame, a Parisian cathedral and prominent example of Gothic architecture.

                        This style of painting, sculpture, and decorative art was characterized by a focus on nature and individualism, the thought of man as independent and self-reliant. Though these ideals were present in the late Medieval period, they flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries, paralleling social and economic changes like secularization.

                        The Renaissance reached its height in Florence, Italy, due in large part to the Medici, a wealthy merchant family who adamantly supported the arts and humanism, a variety of beliefs and philosophies that places emphasis on the human realm. Italian designer Filippo Brunelleschi and sculptor Donatello were key innovators during this period.

                        The High Renaissance, which lasted from 1490 to 1527, produced influential artists such as da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, each of whom brought creative power and spearheaded ideals of emotional expression. Artwork throughout the Renaissance was characterized by realism, attention to detail, and precise study of human anatomy. Artists used linear perspective and created depth through intense lighting and shading. Art began to change stylistically shortly after the High Renaissance, when clashes between the Christian faith and humanism gave way to Mannerism.

This yielded more complex, stylized compositions rather than relying on the classical ideals of harmonious composition and linear perspective used by their Renaissance predecessors.

                        Some of the most celebrated Mannerist artists include Giorgio Vasari, Francesco Salviati, Domenico Beccafumi, and Bronzino, who is widely considered to be the most important Mannerist painter in Florence during his time.

                        Baroque paintings were characterized by drama, as seen in the iconic works of Italian painter Caravaggio and Dutch painter Rembrandt. Painters used an intense contrast between light and dark and had energetic compositions matched by rich color palettes.

Instead, Romantic artists emphasized the individual and imagination. Another defining Romantic ideal was an appreciation for nature, with many turning to plein air painting, which brought artists out of dark interiors and enabled them to paint outside. Artists also focused on passion, emotion, and sensation over intellect and reason.

                        The 1970s marked the beginning of contemporary art, which extends through present day. This period is dominated by various schools and smaller movements that emerged.

                        Postmodernism: In reaction against modernism, artists created works that reflected skepticism, irony, and philosophical critiques.

                        Feminist art: This movement arose in an attempt to transform stereotypes and break the model of a male-dominated art history.

                        Neo Expressionism: Artists sought to revive original aspects of Expressionism and create highly textural, expressive, large works.

                        Street art: Artists such as Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Barry McGee, Banksy, and more created graffiti-like art on surfaces in public places like sidewalks, buildings, and overpasses.

                        The Pictures Generation: Artists Cindy Sherman, Louise Lawler, Gary Simmons, and others who were influenced by Conceptual and Pop art experimented with recognizable imagery to explore images shaped our perceptions of the world.

                        Appropriation art: This movement focused on the use of images in art with little transformation from their original form.

                        Young British Artists (YBA): This group of London artists were notorious for their willingness to shock audiences through their imagery, and a willingness to push beyond limits of decency. They’re also known for their zestful, entrepreneurial spirit.

                        Digital art: The advent of the camera lent way to this artistic practice that allowed artists to use the infusion of art and technology to create with mediums like computers, audio and visual software, sound, and pixels.
